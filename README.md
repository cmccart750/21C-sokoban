The classic box-pushing game, but with conveyor belts!

Built as a school project over a couple of weeks.
I've included enough folders to rebuild the Unity project, and a Windows x64 build if you just want to check out the game.

When I get caught up on class, I plan to clean up and improve the conveyor belt logic, then build some better, more
complex levels.

Enjoy!


## Game Controls

W/A/S/D or arrow keys to move.

Escape to open pause menu (restart levels, go to main menu)

Walk into a box to push it (if nothing is blocking it)

Press Space to interact with switches on the wall (red squares)

Every time you take a step, every object on a conveyor will also move 1 square.

Try to beat each level with as few moves as possible!

Space bar will also let you "skip a turn" if you just want to advance the conveyors and not move the player.

If you are tired of opening the pause menu, you can also restart levels using Backspace.
